# Computer Science Theory Paper [2022 Exam]

## Decomposition and Abstractaion

* Benifits of decomposition and abstractation to analyse, understand, and solve problems.

## Algorithms

* Following and writing alogrithms (flowcharts) taht use sequence, selection, input, processing, and output to solve problems. 
* Following algorithms that use variables, constants, and arrays.
* Using a trace table to determine the value of a variable at a given point in an algorithm.
* Understanding how standard algorithms (linear search) work.  
* Using logical reasoning to evaluate an algorithm's fitness for purpose, and efficiency.

## Binary

* Understand how computers represent and manipulate two's complement signed integers.  
* Be able to convert between denary and 8-bit binary numbers. 
* Understand the concept of overflow in relation to the number of bits available to store a value.
* Be able to convert between hexadecimal and binary.


## Data Representation

* Understand how computers encode characters using 7-bit ASCII
* Understand how bitmap images are represented in binary (pixels, resolution, colour depth)

## Data Storage and Compression

* Understand that data storage is measured in binary multiples (bit, nibble, byte, kibibyte, mebibyte)
* Be able to construct expressions to calculate file sizes and data capacity
* Understand the need for data compression, and the methods of compressing data (lossy, lossless)
