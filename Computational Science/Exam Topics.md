# Computer Science Theory Paper [2022 Exam]

## Decomposition and Abstractaion

* Benifits of decomposition and abstractation to analyse, understand, and solve problems.

## Algorithms

* Following and writing alogrithms (flowcharts) taht use sequence, selection, input, processing, and output to solve problems. 
* Following algorithms that use variables, constants, and arrays.
* Using a trace table to determine the value of a variable at a given point in an algorithm.
* Understanding how standard algorithms (linear search) work.  
* Using logical reasoning to evaluate an algorithm's fitness for purpose, and efficiency.

## Binary

* Understand how computers represent and manipulate two's complement signed integers.  
* Be able to convert between denary and 8-bit binary numbers. 
* Understand the concept of overflow in relation to the number of bits available to store a value.
* Be able to convert between hexadecimal and binary.


## Data Representation

* Understand how computers encode characters using 7-bit ASCII
* Understand how bitmap images are represented in binary (pixels, resolution, colour depth)

## Data Storage and Compression

* Understand that data storage is measured in binary multiples (bit, nibble, byte, kibibyte, mebibyte)
* Be able to construct expressions to calculate file sizes and data capacity
* Understand the need for data compression, and the methods of compressing data (lossy, lossless)

## Hardware

* Understand the Von Neumann stored program concept.
* Understand the role of secondary storage and the ways that it is stored on devices (magnetic, optical, solid state)
* Understand the concept of an embedded system, and what they are used for. 


## Software

* Understand the purpose and functionality of an operating system (user managment)
* Understand the purpose and function of utility software (data compression)
* Understand the importance of developing robust software. 

## Programming Languages

* Understand the characteristics and purposes of low-level and high-level programming languages.
* Understand the differences between interpreters and compilers in the way they translate high-level code into machine code. 

## Networks

* Understand why computers are connected in a network.
* Understand the different types of networks (LAN, WAN).
* Understand how the internet is structured (IP addresses).
* Understand how the characteristics and speed of wirless and wired networks impact performance (speed, latency).
* Understand that network speeds are measured in bits per second (kilobit, megabit, gigabit).
* Understand the need for email protocols and their roles (POP3, IMAP, SMTP).
* Understand how the 4-layer TCP/IP model (application, transport, internet, link) handles data transmisison over a network. 
* Understand characteristics of network topologies (star, bus, mesh).

## Network Security

* Understand methods of protecting networks (firewalls)

## Ethical and Legal

* Understand the legal issues with the collection and use of personal data (consent, data protection).
* Understand the ethical and legal issues associated with the use of artifical inteligence, machine learning, and robotics (algorithmic bias).

## Cybersecurity

* Understand the methods of protecting digital systems and data (backup and recovery procedures).
