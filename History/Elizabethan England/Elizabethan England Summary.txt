** Queen, Government, and Religion: **

Privy Council (19 members) - Elizabeth's most trusted advisors, led by the secretery of state. They advise the queen, and negotiate between her and parliament

Patronage - Awarding titles, land, and money to members of the court to make sure they would be loyal to her

Hierarchical Society:

** Most Power** 	 ^  Queen
			/ \ Privy Council
			 |  Royal Court
			 |  Nobels
			 |  Gentry, Knights, Lawyers
			 |  Merchant Class
			 |  Yeomen (Owned land)
			 |  Tenant Farmers (rented land from Yeomen)
** Least Power **	 |  Labourers, Servents, The Poor


** Parliament - Passes Laws, Sets Taxes, and Advises the Queen: **

Elizabeth only called parliament when she needed them - to raise taxes, or for a serious crisis. She called parliament 13 times in total during her reign (less than 1 session every 3 years)

House of Lords: 100 lords, bishops, and judges

House of Commons: 450 MPs who were elected by local landowners - elections were not "free", as the state controlled the balot in some places to elect a particular political figure

The power of Parliament limited the Monarch's power


** Eliazabeth's Problems **

Threat from abroad - Elizabeth faced potential invasion from Scotland and France when she became queen

Debts: Elizabeth inherited £300,000 in debt when she came to power

Needed a Heir: Without a husband, Elizabeth would not have a heir, meaning that there would likely be instability when she died.
	       However if Elizabeth married she would give her power away to her husband.

Female Ruler: Many people belived that women were incapable of being powerful rulers, so did not support Elizabeth as queen

Illigitimate Heir: Henry VIII (Elizabeth's Father) claimed at one point that Elizabeth was an Illigitimate heir.
		   Also, the Catholic church did not recognise Henry's early divorse, meaning that Elizabeth also wasn't legitimate in the eyes of Catholics either.

Mary Queen of Scots: Catholic Monarch of Scotland who had the support of France.
		     Overthrown by Protestant MPs and fled to England. Seen as a threat by Elizabeth, as Catholics could rebel against her to put Mary on the throne.


** Mary Queen of Scots **

* Elizabeth's Cousin
* Became Queen of Scotland from the age of 6
* Married King Francis II in 1558 and moved to France (increased risk of French invasion)
* Francis died in 1560, causing Mary to return to Scotland
* 1567 - Mary was accused of murdering Darnley 
* Mary married the Earl of Bothwell a few weeks later
* Overthrown by the Scottish Earls, fled to England

A Threat:
* Mary was seen as a threat because...
* Potential Catholic Figurehead
* Potential claim to the English Throne

Solution:
* Held captive for 19 years whilst Elizabeth decided her punishment
* Eventually executed for catholic plots against Elizabeth


** The Religious Settlement **

Catholic vs Protestant vs Puritan

Communion: IS the blood and body of christ vs REPRESENTS the blood and body (same with Puritan)

Authority: The Pope vs Queen Elizabeth (same with Puritan)

Decoration: Richly Decorated vs Moderatly Decorated vs Plainly Decorated

Clergy: Richly Decorated vestments (robes) vs Not as decorated vs Simple Black Gowns

Services: Latin Bible and Latin Mass vs English Bible and Services (same with Puritan)

Structure: Pope, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops vs Archbishops, Bishops vs Elected Church Commitee.


Religious Settlement - Elizabeth made a compromise between Catholics and Puritans by passing laws:

* Offical Religion - Protestantism was made the official religion of England

* Act of Uniformity [1559] - Services in English, with Common Book of Prayer. However Catholics could pray as they wanted in private
		      Some decorations and vestments (robes) kept from Catholic church

* Act of Supremacy [1559] - Elizaabeth was the "governor" of the Church, not the head. Catholics could still believe that the Pope was in charge.
			    Priests were allowed to marry.
