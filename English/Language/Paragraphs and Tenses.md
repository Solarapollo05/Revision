# English Revision - Paragraphs and Tenses

## Paragraphs
Generally, each paragraph contains one key point/focus. Paragraphs often begin with a topic sentence, which introduces the key point. They then expand on these sentences with evidence or examples.

Writers often end paragraphs with hooks, which encourage readers to think about the main point of a paragraph, or end by leading into the next paragraph.

## Paragraph Lengths
The length of a paragraph can also be significant:
* A writer may use a long sentence to build up a detailed description of a setting.

* A writer may use a one sentence paragraph to emphasise a point or a rhetorical question.

<br>

## When to start a new paragraph
You need to start a new sentence when:
* Change of Location
* Change of Time
* The action changes
* A new character or idea is introduced
* Change of the person speaking

## Effect of Paragraphs
In your exam, you should discuss:
* The order of the ideas (paragraphs)
* The number of paragraphs in a piece of writing
* The length of the paragraphs
* How the paragraphs are structured

## Past and Present Tense
* Past tense verbs tell you that something has happened already. An example is *"danced"*

* Present tense show that something is happening right now, for example *"I am dancing"*

* Future tense shows that something will happen, for example *"I will dance"*
