# English Revision - Writing Formats

## Articles
An article informs readers about a topic. There are two main types:
* Newspaper Article (broadsheet) - contains lots of facts, and is normally written in an informative style, and a wise tone. 

* Personal Newspaper (tabloid) - written by writers expressing their own opinion, so their personality will be expressed more. The writing style will often be less formal, and more informing. 
<br>

### Features of Articles
* An interesting/original title which interests the reader.

* A strapline (a sentence adding detail to the title by explaining it and giving context).

* Subheadings to break up the article.

* An introductory paragraph which gives a brief summary of the entire article.

* Paragraphs that flow well into each other.

<br>

## Reports / Essays
Essays or Reports are designed to inform readers, and advise them about what they should do or behave. They should use formal/impersonal language, and not appear biased. 

The job of a report writer is to inform and advise. You should use an objective tone, whilst still showing your viewpoint. Reports are written for a specific audience, whilst essays are targeted at a wide range of people. 

<br>

### Features of an Essay / Report
* An effective and interesting introduction.

* Paragraphs that flow well into each other.

* A convincing and clear conclusion.

* A logical structure of connected ideas or pros and cons. 

<br>

## Letters
Letters are addressed to organisations or individuals. The tone, formality and language changes depended on who the letter is addressed to.

### Formal Letters:
* Formal letters should use a formal tone.

* If you don't specifically know the person you are writing to, you should use a formal mode of address (Sir/Madam) and sign off with Yours Faithfully.

* You should use formal language, and avoid colloqual terms (slang).

### Informal Letters:
* If you are writing to someone you know, you can be less formal. However, letters are more formal than text messages.

* You could use an informal address, but start the letter with *Dear Peter*, and could sign off with *all the best* or *best wishes*.

* Whilst you would not use complex language or structural devices, you should do this in your exams to show your skill to the examiners. 

<br>

### Features of a Letter
* Correct use of a From and To address at the top of the letter. 

* Inclusion of the date you wrote the letter.

* Awareness of audience (formal/informal audience)

* Paragraphs which flow into eachother, with a logical structure.

* An appropriate sign off (*Yours Faithfully* or *See you soon*).


<br>

## Speaches
Speaches are designed to persuade or inspire the audience. Good speaches use emotive language, as well as rhetorical techniques. 

Persuasive speaches need a structure that is motivating and memorable to encourage the audience to act. Having a key message and a peak/climax in you speach creates momentum, exciting the croud, and making the speach more memorable. 

<br>

### Language used in speaces
* Speaches are presented, not read like a book.

* This makes the literary techniques like alliteration, rhetorical questions, sibilance, onomatopoeia, repetition, and rule of three more powerful.

* Try reading each paragraph in your head after writing it, to see what it sounds like when read aloud. 

<br>

### Features of a Speach
* Addresses the audience directly (using *you* or *we*).

* Engages with the audience directly (eg rhetorical questions).

* Have one or two key arguments which they link each paragraph back to.

* A mixture of short and long sentences to maintain the reader's interest.

* A strong conclsion to motivate action, and a clear signal that the speach has finished (eg *Thank you for listening*)

<br>

## Leaflets
Leaflets are normally designed to advise, infor, or persuade an audience. They can either have a general audience (eg a leaflet from the government distributed nationally), or a more focused audience (eg a local council leaflet)

<br>

### Features of a Leaflet
* An interesting title or headline.

* Subheadings or boxes which group information into clusters (there can still be paragraphs/bullet points in these sections)

* The writing has a logical structure, and a coherent (understandable) arguement.

* Each paragraph would make sense on its own when removed from the others. 

<br>

## Reviews
Reviews share someone's opinion on something, similar to a Personal Newspaper Article. People write reviews to give their opinion on how bad or good something is/was. 

You will need to tailor your review to suit the audience you are writing for - a review of an opera will likely be more formal than a fashion review. 

<br>

### Purpose of a Review
Reviews can have different purposes, and may even have more than one. They could be:
* For entertainment,
* For Advice
* To Inform

<br>

### Features of a Review
* A review should include your personal opinion.

* You should give your opinion in the introduction, and refer to it constantly, as well as in the conclusion.

* A review needs to be informative enough for someone to understand the thing that you are reviewing. 

* It should be entertaining enough that people want to finish reading it. 

<br>

## Travel Writing
