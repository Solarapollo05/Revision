## Metaphor
Saying that something **is** another thing, for example:
> *The moon **is** a balloon, rising into the sky.*

<br>

## Simile
Saying something is **like** another thing, using "like" or "as", for example:
> *The boys were **like** two peas in a pod.*

<br>

## Personification
Giving human characteristics to something non-human to create imagery, for example:
> *The frosty wind **moaned.***

<br>

## Pathetic Fallacy
Giving human emotion to things that are not human, often the weather, for example:
> *The **furious** winds blew across the plains.*

<br>

## Alliteration
The same letter or sound at the begining of words near each other. It has several different types:

* Plosive alliteration - "d", "b", "t", or "p" sounds are strong, and grab the readers attention.

* Fricative alliteration - "f", "v", "th", or "ph" sounds can either be soft, or agressive.

* Africative alliteration - contrasting soft and harsh versions of the same sound/letter are strange and jarring. 
<br>

## Sibilance
A more specific version of alliteration, which focuses on "s" sounds, for example:
> *A **s**trange **s**izzle **s**oftly filled the **s**ilent **s**ky.*
